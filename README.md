🩻 X-ray Image Diagnosis Generator
A web application that uses deep learning to analyze X-ray images and generate descriptive diagnostic captions. Built with Streamlit for an intuitive user experience, this tool is designed for educational, research, and demonstration purposes.

🚀 Features
AI-Powered Diagnosis: Upload any X-ray image and receive an automated diagnostic description.

User-Friendly Interface: Simple, two-page navigation (Project Info & Diagnosis).

Fast & Secure: All processing is done locally or on your server-no patient data leaves your machine.

Educational Tool: Great for students and researchers to explore AI in radiology.

⚠️ Disclaimer
This tool is for educational and research purposes only.

It is not intended for clinical use or as a substitute for professional medical advice.

🧠 How It Works
The backend uses a deep learning image captioning model (e.g., BLIP or ViT-GPT2) to analyze X-ray images.

The frontend, built with Streamlit, allows users to upload images and view results in a clean interface.
